 * the record is written (de-blocking). Modify this behavior by passing a de-blocking code in C:
 * - if C = 0, performs deferred write to a potentially allocated sector. If the
 *   sector is already allocated, it is pre-read and the record is inserted where required.
 * - if C = 1, performs undeferred write, i.e. flushes write to disk immediately.
 * - if C = 2, performs deferred write to an unallocated sector, writing to its first
 *   record without pre-reading.
 * Returns exit code in A: 0 for success, 1 for unrecoverable error, and 0xff if media changed.
