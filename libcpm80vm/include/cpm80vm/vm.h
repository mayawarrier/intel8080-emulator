/*
 * 8-bit virtual machine for CP/M 2.2.
 *
 * To get the machine running:
 * - implement its serial and disk devices,
 * - initalize the members of cpm80_vm as required,
 * - call cpm80_vm_init()
 * - then cpm80_vm_poweron().
 *
 * When powered on, you can run CPU instructions in a loop like so:
 * while(!i8080_next(vm->cpu)) {...}
 *
 * To power off, call cpm80_vm_poweroff() within the body of
 * the loop above or from another thread. The next call to
 * i8080_next() will exit with -1. 
 * 
 * See sample_vm.c for an example.
